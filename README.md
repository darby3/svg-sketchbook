# Ready Set Fractal

Just a project to help quick start development using [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), as driven by npm scripts.

## Getting started

* Edit fractal.js to set a project title.
* npm install
* npm run dev

## Notes

* favicon.ico is a placeholder because, for some reason, for me, when fractal looks for a file, and can't find it, it crashes and burns.
* ./public/global.css will fill itself up on the first run.

## Thanks

All props and thanks to Rachel Andrew and [this post on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/pattern-library-first-css/); this repo is basically just the results of that, tweaked to taste, and shifted to use npm scripts instead of Gulp.
